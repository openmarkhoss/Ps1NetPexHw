* Additional Reasons This Is Hard (And Why It Matters)

* Network reality is not uniform
* Most modern netplay solutions quietly assume:
* stable broadband
* low jitter
* consistent routing
* data-center proximity
* This assumption breaks down globally
* Large parts of the world still rely on:
* dial-up or DSL
* mobile networks
* high-latency international routing
* unstable last-mile connections
* A system that only works on “perfect internet” is not truly global

* Distance is not a corner case
* Many players who want online PlayStation gaming live:
* far from major internet hubs
* across continents from friends
* behind unpredictable routing paths
* For these users:
* latency is unavoidable
* jitter is normal
* packet loss is expected
* Ps1NetPexHw treats these conditions as the baseline, not as failure cases

* Cultural and community differences matter
* In many regions (for example Brazil, parts of Latin America, Southern Europe, and Asia):
* gaming communities are highly collaborative
* players are used to working around limitations
* experimentation is welcomed
* shared problem-solving is common
* These communities often:
* keep older hardware alive longer
* repair, adapt, and remix technology
* value playability over perfection
* This mindset aligns closely with an experimental, honest approach to netplay

* Older hardware thrives where modern assumptions fail
* In places where:
* new consoles are expensive
* internet upgrades are slow
* older systems remain popular
* PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 are not nostalgia — they are living platforms
* Any attempt at real-hardware netplay that ignores these regions ignores a large part of its potential audience

* Why stabilizing time matters more than speed
* High-speed internet hides problems
* Slower or unstable networks expose them
* By:
* stabilizing latency
* aligning input to time
* making delay visible instead of hidden
* Ps1NetPexHw can remain usable across:
* fast urban networks
* slow rural links
* long international routes
* The experience changes, but the system does not collapse

* This project is not built for one country
* Ps1NetPexHw is intentionally designed to:
* tolerate distance
* accept delay
* avoid assumptions about infrastructure
* It does not try to “win” against physics
* It tries to work honestly within it
* That makes it more inclusive by design

* Why this complexity is worth embracing
* If this project only worked:
* on perfect fiber
* in one region
* under ideal conditions
* Then it would solve a narrow problem
* By embracing difficulty instead of avoiding it, Ps1NetPexHw explores whether real-hardware netplay can exist globally, not just locally
