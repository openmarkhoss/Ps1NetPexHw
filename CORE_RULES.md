RULE 1: TIME BELONGS TO THE ENDPOINT
Each device maintains its own clock and never trusts the network for timing.

RULE 2: LATENCY IS STABILIZED, NOT ELIMINATED
Input is deliberately delayed and aligned to frames rather than injected immediately.

RULE 3: FAILURE MUST BE VISIBLE
Ping, link state, and errors are always exposed to the user.
